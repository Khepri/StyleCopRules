# Assessment of rules


## Documentation Rules (SA1600-)

### Sane

* [SA1603: DocumentationMustContainValidXml](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1603.html)

  There is no reason to ever accept invalid XML.

* [SA1604: ElementDocumentationMustHaveSummary](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1604.html)

  I can't think of any meaningful exceptions to this rule - provided you have a documentation element, it should have a summary.

* [SA1608: ElementDocumentationMustNotHaveDefaultSummary](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1604.html)

  Obvious and admirable! A shame that so many of the other StyleCop rules for documentation invite developers to commit the exact same sin by turning to autogenerated documentation to fulfill a meaningless demand.

### Insane

* [SA1600: ElementsMustBeDocumented](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1600.html)

  No, I don't think they must. Mandatory documentation of all code elements inevitably leads to autogeneration of documentation based on the code elements themselves - hence the documentation can obviously not tell you anything not already in the code, obviating the need for the documentation in the first place. The result is "undocumentation" that clutters the code and harms readability.

* [SA1601: PartialElementsMustBeDocumented]()
 
  Ref SA1600.

* [SA1602: EnumerationItemsMustBeDocumented]()

  The StyleCop documentation for this rule nicely illustrates the type of meaningless undocumentation you incur on your code base when this rule is enabled. "Dog: Represents a dog."
