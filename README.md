# Assessment of rules


## Documentation Rules (SA1600-)

I think it's a very bad idea to use a static analysis tool to mandate documentation of all code elements. It inevitably leads to very low-quality documentation. The only redeeming feature of such a tool is that it leads to high documentation coverage. Measuring documentation coverage is a completely meaningless exercise because it is easy - trivial - to autogenerate documentation (using ReSharper, GhostDoc or what have you). Autogenerated documentation is worthless. In fact, it's worse that useless. Autogenerated documentation is a source of noise that leads to code that is less readable and makes it harder to find genuine documentation in the code base. 

See http://www.stylecop.com/docs/Documentation%20Rules.html

### Sane

* [SA1603: DocumentationMustContainValidXml](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1603.html)

  There is no reason to ever accept invalid XML.

* [SA1604: ElementDocumentationMustHaveSummary](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1604.html)

  I can't think of any meaningful exceptions to this rule - provided you have a documentation element, it should have a summary.

* [SA1608: ElementDocumentationMustNotHaveDefaultSummary](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1604.html)

  Obvious and admirable! A shame that so many of the other StyleCop rules for documentation invite developers to commit the exact same sin by turning to autogenerated documentation to fulfill a meaningless demand.

* [SA1610: PropertyDocumentationMustHaveValueText](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1610.html)

  Empty documentation is always nonsensical.
  
* [SA1613: ElementParameterDocumentationMustDeclareParameterName](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1613.html)

  This is meaningful granted that you're documenting a parameter.
  
* [SA1614: ElementParameterDocumentationMustHaveText](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1614.html)

  Empty documentation is always nonsensical.
  
* [SA1616: ElementReturnValueDocumentationMustHaveValue](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1616.html)

  This is fine, an empty return tag makes no sense.

* [SA1617: VoidReturnValueMustNotBeDocumented](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1617.html)

  Sure, this is flagging an error.

* [SA1620: GenericTypeParameterDocumentationMustMatchTypeParameters](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1620.html)

  I suppose this makes sense given that the developer has come up with meaningful documentation for the type parameters (but ref SA1618 in the Insane category).

* [SA1621: GenericTypeParameterDocumentationMustDeclareParameterName](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1621.html)

  Ref SA1620.

* [SA1622: GenericTypeParameterDocumentationMustHaveText](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1622.html)

  Ref SA1620.
  
* [SA1625: ElementDocumentationMustNotBeCopiedAndPasted](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1625.html)

  Under serious doubt. Silly to check for, yet hard to envision meaningful duplicate comments. I suppose duplicate comments (due to copy-and-paste) will only happen if the project runs a static analysis tool that requires all code elements to be documented.

* [SA1626: SingleLineCommentsMustNotUseDocumentationStyleSlashes](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1626.html)

  This is OK, no need to use triple-slash for regular code comments.
  
* [SA1627: DocumentationTextMustNotBeEmpty](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1627.html)

  It makes no sense for the documentation text to be empty - in that case the entire documentation of the element should be deleted.

* [SA1644: DocumentationHeadersMustNotContainBlankLines](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1644.html)

  Ambivalent. A bit silly, but fair enough.

* [SA1645: IncludedDocumentationFileDoesNotExist](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1645.html)

  In case _include_ is used the file should clearly exist.

* [SA1646: IncludedDocumentationXPathDoesNotExist](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1646.html)

  Similar to SA1645.

* [SA1647: IncludeNodeDoesNotContainValidFileAndPath](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1647.html)

  Similar to SA1645.
  
* [SA1648: InheritDocMustBeUsedWithInheritingClass](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1648.html)

  I've never seen this tag used, but I suppose it's fine.


### Insane

* [SA1600: ElementsMustBeDocumented](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1600.html)

  No, I don't think they must. Mandatory documentation of all code elements inevitably leads to autogeneration of documentation based on the code elements themselves - hence the documentation can obviously not tell you anything not already in the code, obviating the need for the documentation in the first place. The result is "undocumentation" that clutters the code and harms readability.

* [SA1601: PartialElementsMustBeDocumented](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1601.html)
 
  Ref SA1600.

* [SA1602: EnumerationItemsMustBeDocumented](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1602.html)

  The StyleCop documentation for this rule nicely illustrates the type of meaningless undocumentation you incur on your code base when this rule is enabled. "Dog: Represents a dog."

* [SA1605: PartialElementDocumentationMustHaveSummary](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1605.html)

  I see no reason for applying this rule.
  
* [SA1609: PropertyDocumentationMustHaveValue](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1609.html)

  Reading the StyleCop documentation for this rule is sufficient to realize it is nonsense. What you possibly write that is not already covered by the name of the property or the summary description? The documentation of the value is doomed to become a hollow echo of the two.

* [SA1611: ElementParametersMustBeDocumented](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1611.html)
  
  While you may sometimes wish to document parameters, it is often not necessary, in particular if the parameter is given a meaningful name. If made mandatory, developers will tend to autogenerate documentation of parameters, resulting in documentation like the following: 
  
  `<param name="profileName">The profile name</param>`
  
  How does this aid the developer in any way?

* [SA1612: ElementParameterDocumentationMustMatchElementParameters](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1612.html)

  This is a silly rule that means you must either document all the parameters or not at all. The developer should be free to document exactly the parameters that need documentation.
  
* [SA1615: ElementReturnValueMustBeDocumented](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1615.html)

  While you may sometimes wish to document the return value, it is often not not necessary.
  If made mandatory, developers will tend to autogenerate documentation of the return value, yielding documentation like the following, which is thoroughly unhelpful:
  
  `<returns>The <see cref="Foo">.</returns>`
  
  How does this aid the developer in any way?
  
* [SA1618: GenericTypeParametersMustBeDocumented](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1618.html)

  I'm struggling to come up with a scenario where you may say something about the generic type parameter besides the obvious fact that it is a generic type parameter (which is the example given in the StyleCop documentation). And of course that's completely redundant and silly.

* [SA1619: GenericTypeParametersMustBeDocumentedPartialClass](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1619.html)

  Ref SA1618.

* [SA1623: PropertySummaryDocumentationMustMatchAccessors](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1623.html)

  Completely absurd. We know what properties are and what they do. If we need documentation for a property, we would like to know why it is there - what the purpose is.
  
* [SA1624: PropertySummaryDocumentationMustOmitSetAccessorWithRestricedAccess](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1624.html)

  Huh? If you want to document a property setter of course you should be able to, regardless of access modifier. It would be equally meaningful to prohibit the documentation of private methods.
  
* [SA1628: DocumentationTextMustBeginWithACapitalLetter](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1628.html)
  
  My experience is that this leads to more false than real positives.
  
* [SA1629: DocumentationTextMustEndWithAPeriod](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1629.html)

  My experience is that this leads to more false than real positives.

* [SA1630: DocumentationTextMustContainWhitespace](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1630.html)

  I see no reason to check for this.
  
* [SA1631: DocumentationTextMustMeetCharacterPercentage](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1631.html)
 
  How do you even come up with rules like this?
  
* [SA1632: DocumentationTextMustMeetMinimumCharacterLength](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1632.html)

  This is meaningless. Encourage your developers to write meaningful documentation.

* [SA1633: FileMustHaveHeader](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1633.html)
  
  WAT?
  
* [SA1634: FileHeaderMustShowCopyright](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1634.html)

  HAHAHAHAH!

* [SA1635: FileHeaderMustHaveCopyrightText](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1635.html)

  Stop it.
  
* [SA1636: FileHeaderCopyrightTextMustMatch](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1636.html)

  This is pure trolling.
  
* [SA1637: FileHeaderMustContainFileName](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1637.html)

  Meaningless.

* [SA1638: FileHeaderFileNameDocumentationMustMatchFileName](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1638.html)

  If SA1637 is enabled, yes, but it's not.

* [SA1639: FileHeaderMustHaveSummary](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1639.html)

  But there is no file header. There shouldn't be one.

* [SA1640: FileHeaderMustHaveValidCompanyText](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1640.html)

  Meaningless.

* [SA1641: FileHeaderCompanyNameTextMustMatch](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1641.html)

  Meaningless.

* [SA1642: ConstructorSummaryDocumentationMustBeginWithStandardText](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1642.html)

  This may be the most stupid rule of them all. Standard documentation stating that a constructor creates a new instance of a class? Thank you.

* [SA1643: DestructorSummaryDocumentationMustBeginWithStandardText](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1643.html)

  As stupid as SA1642, but less impact since destructors are scarce.

* [SA1649: FileHeaderFileNameDocumentationMustMatchTypeName](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1649.html)

  But there is still no file header.

* [SA1650: ElementDocumentationMustBeSpelledCorrectly](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1650.html)

  A factory for producing false positives. It's not worth the effort to have developers spend their time maintaining a dictionary to have StyleCop close down that factory. 


## Layout Rules (SA1500-)

I think it's OK to follow some layout rules, to the extent they help the project avoiding code that is simply sloppily written.

See http://www.stylecop.com/docs/Layout%20Rules.html

### Sane

* [SA1500: CurlyBracketsForMultiLineStatementsMustNotShareLine](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1500.html)

  Ambivalent, on occasion it makes sense to have empty curly brackets on a single line.

* [SA1503: CurlyBracketsMustNotBeOmitted](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1503.html)

  Optional curly brackets should not be optional.

* [SA1505: OpeningCurlyBracketsMustNotBeFollowedByBlankLine](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1505.html)

  This is just proper code hygiene.

* [SA1506: ElementDocumentationHeadersMustNotBeFollowedByBlankLine](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1506.html)

  This is just proper code hygiene.

* [SA1507: CodeMustNotContainMultipleBlankLinesInARow](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1507.html)

  This is just proper code hygiene.

* [SA1508: ClosingCurlyBracketsMustNotBePrecededByBlankLine](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1508.html)

  This is just proper code hygiene.

* [SA1509: OpeningCurlyBracketsMustNotBePrecedededByBlankLine](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1509.html)

  This is just proper code hygiene.

* [SA1510: ChainedStatementBlocksMustNotBePrecededByBlankLine](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1510.html)

  This is just proper code hygiene.

* [SA1511: WhileDoFooterMustNotBePrecededByBlankLine](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1511.html)

  This is just proper code hygiene (although I've never seen this violated).

* [SA1514: ElementDocumentationHeaderMustBePrecededByBlankLine](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1514.html)

  This is just proper code hygiene (and may actually occur in practice).

* [SA1516: ElementsMustBeSeparatedByBlankLine](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1516.html)

  This is just proper code hygiene.

* [SA1517: CodeMustNotContainBlankLinesAtStartOfFile](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1517.html)

  This is just proper code hygiene.

* [SA1518: CodeMustNotContainBlankLinesAtEndOfFile](http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1518.html)

  This is just proper code hygiene.


### Insane

* [SA1501: StatementMustNotBeOnSingleLine]

  IMHO the code is sometimes more readable on a single line. YMMV.

* [SA1502: ElementMustNotBeOnSingleLine]

  Sometimes being concise helps readability.

* [SA1504: AllAccessorMustBeMultiLineOrSingleLine]()

  Only makes sense if you only ever have trivial property implementation (in which case - heresy! - you might as well have used fields instead, even though .NET lore indicates that this is very bad, m'kay?). It may well be that one accessor (e.g. `get`) is very simple whereas the other one is more complex.

* [SA1512: SingleLineCommentsMustNotBeFollowedByBlankLine]()

  I don't quite see the problem and would rather be a bit too permissive than needlessly strict - I wouldn't want to break the build over this.

* [SA1515: SingleLineCommentMustBePrecededByBlankLine]()

  Ref SA1512.
